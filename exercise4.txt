Exercise-4:

Script kiddies: Source or come up with a text manipulation problem and solve it with at least two of awk, sed, tr
and / or grep. Check the question below first though, maybe. [10pts]

== Solution ==
I did not use any references to solve this problem.

Problem: Extract partial host names and output as comma separated values from input.txt file (format shown below)

-- input.txt --
host1.example1.com,UP,east_coast1
some garbage line1
host2.example1.com,DOWN,east_coast2
some garbage line2
host3.example1.com,UP,east_coast1
some garbage line3
host4.example1.com,UP,east_coast1
some garbage line4

-- Desired output is to get comma separated list of partial hostnames as below
host1,host2,host3,host4

-- solution-1 (used grep, awk, sed, tr) --
egrep example1.com input.txt | awk -F, '{print $1}' | sed 's/.example1.com//g' | tr "\n" ",";echo

-- solution-2 (used awk,sed,tr) --
awk -F, '/example1.com/{print $1}' input.txt | sed 's/.example1.com//g' | tr "\n" "," | sed 's/\,$//g';echo
