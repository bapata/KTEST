Exercise-3:

All the continuouses: Write a simple build and deployment pipeline for the above using groovy / Jenkinsfile,
Travis CI or Gitlab CI. [15 pts]

== Solution ==
### I watched this video and understood how to integrate jenkins with kubernetes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4kYbHlQYHg

### I copied the Jenkins file from the video ( The CI/CD I use at my job has a layer where sequence/rules are specified as a YAML file)

### Jenkins CI/CD file to deploy litecoin stateful sets.
### The pipeline uses kubernetes pod as agent. It clones jenkinsfiles.git which contains litecoin statefulset deployment YAML file
### The kubetl apply is done as part of the Jenkins job by the script kubernetesDeploy.

pipeline {
  agent { label 'kubepod' }

  states {
    stage {
      steps {
        git url:'https://github.com/bapata/jenkinsfiles.git', branch: 'master'
      }
    }
    stage {
      steps {
        script {
          kubernetesDeploy(configs: litecoin.yaml, kubeconfigID: "litecoinconfig")
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
